<1.1>
- Now your character can spot obstacles when you're in the middle of a parkour move to avoid getting through solid props/walls
- You can either tap or keep pressing the key down and your character will keep parkouring
- Added some new functions in the config file: CanBeginParkour, ParkourBegin, ParkourEnd. They'll help you customize the script to your liking
- Move list remade with some changes to use with the new functions
- No more sinking into the ground when you jump to grab a ledge
- Your character now has a better sense of their surroundings. No more weird jumps or moves
- Jumping is now correctly disabled to avoid any issues
- Fixed ragdolls, they won't send your character flying anymore, unfortunately...
- Resolved a server bug that was messing up tackles
